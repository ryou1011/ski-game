## Comments

>I really like this concept. There's a game similar called Grand Mountain Adventure so I am going to base my comments on that. While I don't think this app should copy GMA, I think there are too many elements in this game. I don't really think the crew mode or world builder are really necessary or add much to the game. I would rather have more elements/ways to interact with the core game. The biggest thing I would add would be points for skills like in Skate or time trials. There should be a leaderboard for the fastest times on each map and highest total and individual trick score. All of the maps should have a difficulty rating that is unlocked by playing the previous difficulty like geometry dash. Addiction is key, while the design shouldn't copy GMA, there should be a more consistent, basic reward/goal like points, higher difficulties, or a leaderboard.
